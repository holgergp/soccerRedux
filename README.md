# soccerRedux

This is my attempt of porting my soccerReact app to Redux.
As a first attempt this might seem a bit naive, I will try to take this some steps further

TODO:

- Introduce container components
- Tryout replacement of React Classes with functions
- introduce mapDispatch
- enhance webpack usage
- port tests to redux
